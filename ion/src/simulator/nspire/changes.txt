
comparison with original files:

no changes:

minor changes:
events.cpp: removed haptics
events.h: set SDL sharedExternalTextBufferSize to 0, added declaration of dumpEventCount and logAfter (why?)
framebuffer.cpp: removed comments, changed Window to Main, sFrameBufferActive default to true
telemetry_init.cpp: changed include path

major changes:
events_keyboard.cpp: from events_keyboard_platform.cpp
display.cpp: move framebuffer contents managed by Upsilon to video memory, the concept is the same; void shutdown() renamed to void quit()
keyboard.cpp: removed headless-related keyDown, keyUp and scanHandlesSDLKey, both share returning (State)state
keyboard.h: now only contains keyboard image bitmap
platform.h: WTF
main.cpp: of course they're different

new file:
callback.cpp: useless, not called anywhere
drivers etc.


nspire port adaptations from 3DS:

unchanged:
events.cpp
events.h
framebuffer.cpp
framebuffer.h
telemetry_init.cpp
platform.h
callback.cpp
clipboard.cpp
main.h

changed:
display.h: now #include <n2DLib.h>
display.cpp: memcpy framebuffer to BUFF_BASE_ADDRESS directly. Since Ndless already has a buffer and it is possible to read back from BUFF_BASE_ADDRESS, why not completely abolish that framebuffer? removed assert.h
main.cpp: changed windowWidth to 320, useless; moved timing functions to timing.cpp
callback.cpp: removed
keyboard.cpp: rewritten based on the original SDL thing
keyboard.h: trimmed
events_keyboard.cpp: mostly rewritten
NOTE: some #include and Makefile changes untracked!
n2DLib.h & n2DLib.c: prefix 'GRAFX_' attached to macro 'min' and 'max', they were polluting C++ standard libraries!
timing.cpp: modified based on the original; replace msleep function with the one provided by Ndless
console.cpp: modified based on the original; removed headless-related code
