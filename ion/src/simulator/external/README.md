The sdl directory contains a snapshot of the SDL source code at revision
13105:db9d0d0b7ebc

The n2DLib directory contains a fork of n2DLib at https://github.com/gameblabla/n2DLib with prefix 'GRAFX_' attached to macro 'min' and 'max'

Note that parts of SDL source code are also copied into the path
ion/src/simulator/android/src/java because Gradle expects Java code to live
there...
